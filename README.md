## üìöUseful-resources
Well the first, the main thing of the application is the background and the hooks index so

How is works ?
### background 
layout is the responsible for the routing and the back every has header it doens't matter if is **<span style="color:red">404</span>** it's wrapper on a `div`
```javascript
 const Layout = ( { children }: any ) => {

  const router = useRouter();
  const { pathname } = router;
  
  return (
    <LayoutStyled  path={pathname}>
      <Header></Header>
      {children}
    </LayoutStyled>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```
### Main Hook
this hooks handle the index of the slider if the pages has one
```javascript
const Hook= () => {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState<number>(0);
  const [active, setActive] = useState<boolean>(true);

  const changeActive = ():void => {
    setActive(!active);
  };

  const changeIndex = (index:number):void => {
    setIndex(index);
  };

  return {
    index,
    changeIndex,
    active,
    changeActive
  };
};

export default Hook;
```

### Custom hook
- header index logic
this is a special hooks for see if the user is using firefox on chroome because `backgground-filter:blur()` break the solution on firefox so if it's false has a blur else it doesn't have it
```javascript
const HeaderLogic = () => {
  const [menuActive, setMenuActive] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [isFirefox, setIsFirefox] = useState<boolean>(false);

  useEffect(()=> {
    let userAgent = navigator.userAgent;
    if (userAgent.match(/firefox|fxios/i)) {
      setIsFirefox(true);
    }

  },[]);
 
  const handleMenuActive = ():void => {
    setMenuActive(!menuActive);
  };

  return {
    menuActive,
    handleMenuActive,
    isFirefox,
  };
};

export default HeaderLogic;
```
